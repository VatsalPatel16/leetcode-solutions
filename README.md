## Naming Convention

To maintain consistency and readability, the Java files are named using the following format:

**`ProblemID_ProblemName.java`**

For example:

- `Problem1_TwoSum.java`
- `Problem121_BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock.java`
- `Problem217_ContainsDuplicate.java`

This format ensures clarity by keeping the problem ID and name recognizable while adhering to Java's class naming rules.
